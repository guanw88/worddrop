# worddrop

# Background and Overview
* WordDrop is based on the classic game of Tetris, except that instead of tetraminos, squares with a single letter are dropped. (You can toggle between 4 different letters per block by pressing tab.)
* Instead of gaining points by clearing rows, points are gained whenever a valid 4+ letter words are formed in a row or column.
